# Hive Heroes - Uprising 

_A personal continuation of the original Hive Heroes project._

## Overview

Hive Heroes: Uprising is a top-down 2D action-adventure game where you play as a lone bee fighting through corrupted regions of the hive. 
What starts as a simple nectar-collection mission turns into a confrontation with a power-obsessed Queen and the ruins she left behind.

This repo is my personal version of the game after the class project was completed. 
Here I’ll be:
- Refactoring code
- Adding new mechanics
- Tweaking combat and horde behavior
- Expanding lore (including the LOTR-inspired Easter egg 👀)

## Tech

- Language: Java
- Style: 2D tile-based, custom engine
- Features:
  - Multiple regions (Grass, Volcano, Frost, Hive, Maze, etc.)
  - Enemy types (Spiders, Goblins, Crabs, Frost Dragons, Bats)
  - Power-ups (tunics, projectiles, stamina/health, Easter eggs)

## Development Workflow

Even though I’m solo on this repo, I’m using a proper workflow:

- `feature/*` branches – experiments, new mechanics, refactors
- Changes merged via Pull Requests only (no direct pushes to `master`)

## LOTR Easter Egg

See `lotr_easter_egg_notes.txt` for design notes and hints about the hidden Lord of the Rings–inspired content.
