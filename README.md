===============================================================

Hive Heroes: Uprising is a personal continuation of the original Hive Heroes game created during SER225. 
The class version is complete and stands on its own. 
This repo exists so I can keep learning, experimenting, and pushing myself as a developer by building on top of something I enjoyed working on.

This project lets me:
- try out new ideas  
- clean up or reorganize systems  
- explore new mechanics  
- test enemy behavior changes  
- redesign maps  
- expand the lore  
- and basically see how far I can take the game on my own

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

Hive Heroes: Uprising is a 2D top-down action game built in Java using a custom engine. 
It keeps the core idea of navigating through damaged regions of the hive while uncovering the truth behind the Queen’s intentions.

This repo gives me the freedom to test features that didn’t fit in the class timeline and explore areas I want to develop further.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Current Features

- Multiple regions: Grasslands, Volcano, Frost, Hive interior, Maze  
- Enemy types: spiders, goblins, crabs, frost dragons, bats  
- Stamina, health, XP, melee + projectile combat  
- Tunics and power-ups (fire, frost, speed, shield)  
- Horde mode behavior  
- Dialogue system and NPC interactions  
- Hidden secrets  
- LOTR-inspired easter egg  

---------------------------------------------------------------

## LOTR Easter Egg

See `lotr_easter_egg_notes.txt` for all design notes, ideas, and logic behind the Lord of the Rings–themed content

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Development Workflow

Even though this repo is solo, I’m using a structured workflow to keep things clean:

**Branch approach:**

- `main` – stable builds only  
- `feature/*` – all new work, changes, and experiments  

All updates go through Pull Requests before merging into `main`.

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Roadmap

General areas I plan to improve or explore:

TBD

---------------------------------------------------------------

## Tech

- Java  
- Custom SER225 engine  
- 2D pixel art  
- VS Code, Git, Piskel, Paint.NET  

This repo is meant to be a clean environment where I can develop freely, break things, fix them, and continue learning as I build out Hive Heroes in my own time.
